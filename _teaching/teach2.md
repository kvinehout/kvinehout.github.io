I led the 30-person upper level bioelectronics lab section. This involved developing rubrics and grading weekly lab reports. The experience allowed me to further develop my communication skills. I provided students with one-on-one tutoring and regular out of class assistance. I consistently received positive teacher evaluations from students.
