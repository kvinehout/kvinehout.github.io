excerpt: 'Background: Botulinum NeuroToxin-A (BoNT-A) relieves muscle spasticity and increases range of motion necessary for stroke rehabilitation. Determining the effects of BoNT-A therapy on brain neuroplasticity could help physicians customize its use and predict its outcome.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Botulinum Toxin-A therapy for treatment of focal spasticity on brain activation and functional connectivity.

Design: We used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to track changes in blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activation and functional connectivity associated with BoNT-A therapy in nine chronic stroke participants, and eight age-matched controls. Scans were acquired before BoNT-A injections (W0) and 6 weeks after the injections (W6). The task fMRI scan consisted of a block design of alternating mass finger flexion and extension. The voxel-level changes in BOLD activation, and pairwise changes in functional connectivity were analyzed for BoNT-A treatment (stroke W0 vs. W6).

Results: BoNT-A injection therapy resulted in significant increases in brain activation in the contralesional premotor cortex, cingulate gyrus, thalamus, superior cerebellum, and in the ipsilesional sensory integration area. Lastly, cerebellar connectivity correlated with the Fugl-Meyer assessment of motor impairment before injection, while premotor connectivity correlated with the Fugl-Meyer score after injection.

Conclusion: BoNT-A therapy for treatment of focal spasticity resulted in increased brain activation in areas associated with motor control, and cerebellar connectivity correlated with motor impairment before injection. These results suggest that neuroplastic effects might take place in response to improvements in focal spasticity.'
